<description>Imagine a country where girls must sneak out to go to school, with deadly consequences if they get caught learning. This was Afghanistan under the Taliban, and traces of that danger remain today. 22-year-old Shabana Basij-Rasikh runs a school for girls in Afghanistan. She celebrates the power of a family's decision to believe in their daughters -- and tells the story of one brave father who stood up to local threats. &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

<title>Shabana Basij-Rasikh: Dare to educate Afghan girls</title>
<seg id="1"> When I was 11, I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house. </seg>
<seg id="2"> My father was listening to BBC News on his small, gray radio. </seg>
<seg id="3"> There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then, because the news mostly depressed him. </seg>
<seg id="4"> "The Taliban are gone!" my father shouted. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I didn't know what it meant, but I could see that my father was very, very happy. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "You can go to a real school now," he said. </seg>
<seg id="7"> A morning that I will never forget. </seg>
<seg id="8"> A real school. </seg>
<seg id="9"> You see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed to be outside alone, to a secret school. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It was the only way we both could be educated. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Each day, we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going. </seg>
<seg id="13"> We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The school was in a house, more than 100 of us packed in one small living room. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer. </seg>
<seg id="16"> We all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents. </seg>
<seg id="17"> From time to time, the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We always wondered what they knew about us. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Were we being followed? </seg>
<seg id="20"> Do they know where we live? </seg>
<seg id="21"> We were scared, but still, school was where we wanted to be. </seg>
<seg id="22"> I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured. </seg>
<seg id="23"> My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time. </seg>
<seg id="24"> A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan, he insisted that his daughter, my mom, go to school, and for that he was disowned by his father. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But my educated mother became a teacher. </seg>
<seg id="26"> There she is. </seg>
<seg id="27"> She retired two years ago, only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And my father -- that's him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> There was no question that his children would receive an education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite the risks. </seg>
<seg id="30"> To him, there was greater risk in not educating his children. </seg>
<seg id="31"> During Taliban years, I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future. </seg>
<seg id="32"> I would want to quit, but my father, he would say, "Listen, my daughter, you can lose everything you own in your life. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Your money can be stolen. You can be forced to leave your home during a war. </seg>
<seg id="34"> But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees, we will. </seg>
<seg id="35"> So do you still not want to continue?" </seg>
<seg id="36"> Today I am 22. </seg>
<seg id="37"> I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school, and had my family not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Instead, I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College. </seg>
<seg id="40"> When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters, was among the first to congratulate me. </seg>
<seg id="41"> He not only brags about my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul. </seg>
<seg id="42"> My family believes in me. </seg>
<seg id="43"> I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me. </seg>
<seg id="44"> That's why I am a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign to educate women. </seg>
<seg id="45"> That's why I cofounded SOLA, the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="47"> And I see their parents and their fathers who, like my own, advocate for them, despite and even in the face of daunting opposition. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Like Ahmed. That's not his real name, and I cannot show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village, and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes. </seg>
<seg id="50"> As he arrived home, the phone rang, a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try again. </seg>
<seg id="51"> "Kill me now, if you wish," he said, "but I will not ruin my daughter's future because of your old and backward ideas." </seg>
<seg id="52"> What I've come to realize about Afghanistan, and this is something that is often dismissed in the West, that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success. </seg>
<seg id="53"> It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success. </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters, but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan, we must have the support of men. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Under the Taliban, girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember, it was illegal. </seg>
<seg id="56"> But today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Afghanistan looks so different from here in America. </seg>
<seg id="58"> I find that Americans see the fragility in changes. </seg>
<seg id="59"> I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal. </seg>
<seg id="60"> But when I am back in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them, who encourage them, I see a promising future and lasting change. </seg>
<seg id="61"> To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities, and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Like me, they are dreaming big. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Thank you. </seg>
